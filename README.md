# Tanguy's Portfolio

Hi! This is the repository for my personal portfolio.

It is themed after a terminal window, and can be used as such.

It is currently hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at [tlp19.github.io/portfolio](https://tlp19.github.io/portfolio/).

To get started, type `help` and press Enter!

## Development and deployment

After making changes to the source code, run `npm run deploy` to build the static website files and publish them to GitHub Pages.

## Credits
