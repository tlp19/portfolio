# Tanguy's Portfolio

Hi! This is the repository for my personal portfolio.

It is themed after a terminal window, and can be used as such.

It is currently hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed at [tlp19.github.io/portfolio](https://tlp19.github.io/portfolio/).

To get started, type `help` and press **Enter**!

## Development and deployment

This project was developed using Node.js `v16.16.0`.

If you have Node.js installed, clone the repo locally and run `npm install` in the root of the project to install all its dependencies.

You can then run `npm start` to launch the local server (hosted on [localhost:3000/portfolio](http://localhost:3000/portfolio)) and view the rendered webpage (updated in real time).

After making changes to the source code, run `npm run deploy` to build the static website files and **deploy** them to **GitHub Pages**.
